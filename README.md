# Roulettech Assignment

Hello, my name is Aditya Gupta and I am an AWS Certified Full Stack Developer! 
In response to the take-home assignment step for the Software Engineer position at Roulettech Inc., I have built a small portfolio website to showcase my skills. As mentioned in the instructions, this website is built using React for the frontend, and Django for the backend. I have developed 3 endpoints for the backend - a GET endpoint for fetching the text, such as introduction, about me, and the education sections. There is another GET enpoint for fetching the comments at the bottom of the page, and finally a POST endpoint for creating new comments. Finally, I have also deployed this website to AWS using S3 for the frontend and EC2 for the backend, while using CloudFront for CDN and a custom VPC with a private subnet in it. 

This was an extremely fun assignment, and I am excited to take on challenges and develop innovative solutions at Roulettech Inc.
